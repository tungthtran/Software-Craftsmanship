# Programming Assignment 3

Programming Assignment 5 adds the timeline method which returns a linked hash map that links a time point to its total duration. 

### Prerequisites

A Java IDE
jdk 13

### Compiling

The codes will be compiled successfully without any errors.

## Running the tests

JUnit test class has been created, which is the ActivityGroupTest. It tests the function of the timeLine method, as well as the class's helper methods and the sort method. 

By clicking run on each test class, the test is green for methods, which means every single one of them operates properly without error.
The assertEquals with 2 matching values is used for testing.

The case for null, 1 element and many (2 elements) are considered for the tests, which will better verify the result of the testing.

The Sort method runs properly both in the Activity Group and inside the TimePointSorter class and is parsed into the parameter of the timeLine method. The method works properly, meaning that all two function without any error.
